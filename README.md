create an algorithm that can balance water levels between 3 glasses with different limits into 1 glass with a certain level

inspiration:

You are given three containers with sizes of 10 pints, 7 pints, and 4 pints.
The 7-pint and 4-pint containers are initially full of water, whereas the 10-pint container is
initially empty. You can pour one container into another until either (i) the source container
is empty or (ii) the destination container is full.
We want to find the sequence of pourings that leaves exactly 2 pints in the 7- or 4-pint
container, if there is such a sequence.
